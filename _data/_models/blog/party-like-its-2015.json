But the island&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Eve celebrations are ranked right up there with New York&rsquo;s in national lists — and here, you can swap a snow parka for a swimsuit. Best of all, guests at The Marker will find Key West&rsquo;s biggest bash right outside their door. The resort&rsquo;s neighbor, Schooner Wharf Bar, hosts famous festivities that make the most of its oceanfront location. Each year at midnight, guests surround the Schooner America 2.0, a tall ship docked at the bar, and watch as a smiling, sword-waving &ldquo;pirate wench&rdquo; is slowly lowered down the mast alongside illuminated countdown numbers and amid the blasts of cannon fire.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(70, 70, 70); background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.901961);\">&ldquo;3, 2, 1 –&nbsp;Arrrgh!&rdquo;</p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(70, 70, 70); background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.901961);\">Okay, you can probably skip on the pirate-speak. (That pretty blonde pirate is actually Schooner Wharf&rsquo;s owner, Evalena Worthington.) But you won&rsquo;t want to miss out on tropical drinks, hours of live music and dancing, and a beautiful moment when a flock of doves are released into the starry night sky, a touching welcome to 2015 that might even make you a bit misty — at least, until the next rum runner arrives. The party goes until 4 AM and there is no cover charge or reservations required.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(70, 70, 70); background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.901961);\">Guests at The Marker are only steps away from the action, which means party pirates can stumble home with just a few strides of their peg legs. In the morning, grab a seat at our poolside restaurant Cero Bodega for a breakfast that will cure what ails ye: steak and eggs, French toast with key lime honey butter, and flavor-filled huevos rancheros will set you on the morning-after road to recovery. (Spoiler: it leads to a lounge chair, your Kindle, and an afternoon of sunning and splashing.)</p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: none; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(70, 70, 70); background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.901961);\">Head here&nbsp;to reserve a room and celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Eve in tropical Key West style.
